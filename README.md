Get In Touch Section Change
In the Navbar of this code I have made changes in get in touch section by adding transparent color to the existing text to make it more interactive
Similarly in Get In Touch Section I have made the height of get in touch section and form section to same height for making the design have less space.
I have also added the shadown to input field to make it more eyecatching . Also I have added translate to the button part to increase its size on hover and also making it more transparent on hover.
In the footer section I have added underline on hover to make it more engaging and in social icon section i have added darker color on hover to show make it more engaging.
